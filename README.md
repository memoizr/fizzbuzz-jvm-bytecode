#FizzBuzz in JVM bytecode
A simple implementation of the famous exercise written in JVM bytecode using Jasmin syntax.

###How to run it:

1 - Run the assembled class file with [scala|java|kotlin] FizzBuzz

You can edit and assemble the bytecode with your favourite Jasmin assembler. I used Krakatau.

Enjoy!
