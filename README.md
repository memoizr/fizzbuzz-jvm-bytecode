#FizzBuzz in JVM bytecode
A simple implementation of the famous exercise written in JVM bytecode using Jasmin syntax.

###How to run it:

- Run the assembled class file with [scala|java|kotlin] FizzBuzz

If you want, you can edit the `FizzBuzz.j` file and assemble it with your favourite Jasmin assembler. I used Krakatau.

Enjoy!
